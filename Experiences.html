      <h1> Internship at Docotrs Without Borders </h1>
        <img src="MSF_Internship.jpg" class="MSF_Internship1">
        <p class= "Paragraph1"> I was an intern at Doctors Without Borders in New York City from September 2017 to May 2018. I worked with different teams on a variety of projects including front-end development of the updated website and strategic marketing planning. I worked on everything from translation projects to development to internal planning and operations. This internship allowed me to explore a variety of areas which helped me focus my interests and gave me experience in a plethora of fields. Everyday at Doctors Without Borders brings a new project and something new to learn.</p>
        <h2> LenusWEAR </h2>
        <img src="LenusWear2.jpg" class= "LenusWear2">
        <p class ="Paragraph2">I am the co-founder of LenusWear, a compression sweatshirt attached to an app that helps people with autism, anxiety, and ADHD. The technology works by targeting specific pressure points on the upper body that studies show decrease stress levels and increase dopamine. Through the app, users can begin the process of compression which will help them concentrate as well as calm down from an anxiety or panic attack. In September of 2017, my co-founders and I were chosen as finalists in the national #BuiltByGirls challenge and flown to San Francisco to pitch our product. We also were #BuiltByGirls ambassadors at TechCrunch. Please see our product pitch <a href= "LenusWear Pitch Deck.pdf">here</a></p>
        <h3> Research </h3>
        <img src="ResearchPoster.png" class= "ResearchPicture">
        <p class="Paragraph3">Imagine being able to grow fuel in your backyard like you grow a tomato plant. A special tank, some algae, plenty of sunlight and voila, the tank pumps out extracted fuel. No more harmful environmental issues from fracking. Low-cost energy, available to all. While this idea seems far fetched, I believe that my research in biofuels is grazing this possibility. I started my research project because I believed that instead of going through the current labor intensive methods of extracting biofuels from algae, I could send low frequency sound waves through the cells for extraction, which would be low-cost and low-energy. The name of my project is Improving Oil Recovery from Algal Biomass Utilizing Quantum Fracturing. I have won first place both in my division and category in the agriscience research fair and have gone to Japan to present my project. You can access my research abstract <a href= "Abstract.pdf">here</a>, my research poster <a href= "LenusWear Pitch Deck.pdf">here</a>
        and my research paper <a href= "Research Paper 2018">here</a>.</p>
        <h4> Memory Competitions <h4>
          <img src ="MemoryPicture.png" class= "MemoryPicture">
          <p class="Paragraph4"> I was a freshman when I discovered memory expansion. I had taken an elective called Memory Training Systems. Here, I learned that people can take huge data sets and organize them into a memory palace. Using this technique, I was soon able to memorize long lists of numbers or automatically memorize a person’s name. I was ecstatic when my memory team was invited for a memory feature on the Good Day New York show. For the show, I was to memorize all the female academy award winners since 1930 by date within fifteen minutes, a list I still happen to know to this day. This skill captured my attention because it give me a way to organize information in my head. Memory technique is all about imagination and developing complex images. It’s an incredible ability that helps develop concentration and creativity. Recently, our team won 4th in the national memory competition and I plan to continue competing throughout college. </p>
