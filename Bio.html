      <h>Hi and welcome to my personal website! I built this site to have a place to store what I achieve throughout my years of education. My passion for computer science, care about environmental issues, and love for my family friends are the characteristics that drive me everyday to achieve. Whether I'm working on research in alternative energy, coding a website or a videogame, reading, or listening to a podcast, my desire for information is constantly pushing me forward and I am excited to share my journey with you through this website. Enjoy! </h>
